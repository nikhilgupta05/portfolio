# Hey there !!
Here are some of the basic code snippets for starters.

## Python

### Virtual Environments
Think of it as new OS (or a new machine) for your python installation. And NOT a new python environment for your OS.

How to setup?
```markdown
"C:\Program Files\Python38\Python.exe" -m venv virtenv
```
- Full path for python.exe is required in case the PATH variable doesn't include it.
- m signifies module
- venv is a tool (the module) to create virtual environment for python3. It is included in the standard python3 installation. In Python2, virtualenv did the similar job.
- virtenv is the name of virtual environment to be created. A folder named virtenv will get created with certain subfolders and files.

** Activate virtual environment **
```markdown
"virtenv/Scripts/activate.bat"
```

** Jupyter notebooks **
```markdown
pip install jupyterlab
```

```markdown
jupyter lab
```


** Deactivate virtual environment **
```markdown
"virtenv/Scripts/deactivate.bat"
```
